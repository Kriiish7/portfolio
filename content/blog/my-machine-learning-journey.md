## How It All Started

My interest in machine learning began during my time at Maiden Erlegh School. What started as curiosity about how computers could "think" has grown into a genuine passion that I'm pursuing through my A-Levels.

### The Spark

It was a simple question that got me started: *How does YouTube know what videos I want to watch?*

This led me down a rabbit hole of:

- Recommendation algorithms
- Pattern recognition
- Data science

## What I've Learned So Far

### Mathematics Foundation

Machine learning relies heavily on mathematics. Key areas I've been studying include:

1. **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices, and transformations
2. **Calculus**: Derivatives and gradients for optimisation
3. **Probability**: Understanding uncertainty and distributions
4. **Statistics**: Making sense of data

### Programming Skills

Python has become my language of choice. I've been working with:

- NumPy for numerical computing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for visualisation
- Scikit-learn for ML algorithms

## Projects I'm Working On

### Image Classification

Building a simple image classifier taught me about:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Evaluation metrics

### Text Analysis

Exploring natural language processing through sentiment analysis projects.

## Looking Ahead

As I continue my studies at Herschel Grammar School, I'm focused on:

- Deepening my understanding of deep learning architectures
- Contributing to open-source ML projects
- Preparing for university courses in Computer Science or AI
